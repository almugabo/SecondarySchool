    | **Encyclopedias (Online & Print)** |  Provides concise summaries and overviews of topics.  Often written by experts.     | Excellent starting point; provides broad context, key terms, and often includes bibliographies/further reading lists (which are *gold* for finding more in-depth sources!).       | Can be too general for in-depth research; may not be updated frequently; often lacks detailed analysis or multiple perspectives.                                           | Getting an initial understanding; identifying key figures, events, and concepts; finding leads to further research. | Use the index and table of contents; look for bibliographies and "further reading" sections at the end of articles. Explore hyperlinked terms within online encyclopedias.                                                                              |
    | **Books (Scholarly & General)** |  Offer in-depth coverage of a topic, often with a specific argument or perspective. |  Comprehensive; provide historical context; explore multiple facets of a topic; often undergo rigorous peer review (especially scholarly books).                                     | Can be lengthy; may be outdated if the topic is rapidly evolving; can be biased depending on the author's perspective; may require access to a library.                      | Gaining a thorough understanding of a topic; exploring different interpretations; finding detailed historical information.  | Use library catalogs (search by keyword, author, subject); use online booksellers (Amazon, Google Books) to preview content and find reviews; check the book's bibliography for additional sources.                                                       |
    | **Scholarly Articles (Journals)** |  Published in academic journals; present original research and analysis.             |  Peer-reviewed (vetted by experts); provide cutting-edge research; offer detailed analysis and evidence; often focus on very specific aspects of a topic.                               | Can be dense and technical; may require specialized knowledge to understand; access may be restricted (often behind paywalls, but school libraries usually provide access). | Understanding current research; exploring specific arguments and evidence; finding detailed methodologies.            | Use academic databases (JSTOR, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar – access through your school library); use advanced search features; pay attention to abstracts (summaries) to determine relevance. Look at the cited references for further leads. |
    | **Primary Sources (Documents, Images, etc.)** |  First-hand accounts or records from the time period being studied.                  |  Provide direct evidence; offer unique perspectives; allow you to interpret events yourself; can be very compelling.                                                               | Can be difficult to find and interpret; may be biased or incomplete; require careful contextualization.                                                              | Understanding the perspectives of people who lived through events; analyzing original documents and artifacts.     | Search online archives (Library of Congress, National Archives, university special collections); use keyword searches tailored to the type of source (e.g., "letters," "diaries," "photographs," "government documents").                          |
    | **Reputable News Articles (In-Depth)** |  Long-form journalism, investigative reports, from established news organizations. |  Provide detailed accounts of events; often include interviews and analysis; can be more accessible than scholarly articles.                                                        | Potential for bias (even in reputable sources); may not be peer-reviewed; can be influenced by editorial perspectives.                                                   | Understanding contemporary perspectives; finding detailed accounts of specific events; exploring different viewpoints.      | Use news archives (e.g., New York Times, BBC, Washington Post); look for articles labeled as "analysis," "investigation," or "long-form"; be aware of the publication's editorial stance.                                                                 |

     | **Websites (.org, .edu, .gov)**      | Websites from organizations with domain names ending on .org, .edu, .gov.      |  Can offer detailed and specialized information .edu (universities) .gov (government).                                                                               | Can be biased.
