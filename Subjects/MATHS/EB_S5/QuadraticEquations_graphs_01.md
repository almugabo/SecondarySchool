# Graphs of Quadratic Equations

Let’s explore how to **graph a quadratic equation** step by step.

Remember: 
- linear equations of the form $y=mx+c$ gives a lines
- quadratic equations of the form $y=ax²+bx+c$ gives a parabola: a **Symmetrical U-shape** 


We will use the example:

$x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$

## 1. Solve the Quadratic Equation (Find the Roots)

We solve by **factorization**:

- two numbers which muötiply to 6 and add to 5
- those numbers are 3 and 2 
$x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0$

So the solutions are:

* $x = -2$
* $x = -3$

These are the **x-intercepts** of the parabola.

---

## 2. Find the X-Intercepts

The graph of the quadratic crosses the x-axis at the roots.

* $(-2, 0)$
* $(-3, 0)$

---

## 3. Find the Y-Intercept

The y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis ($x = 0$).

Substitute $x = 0$ into the equation:

$y = 0^2 + 5(0) + 6 = 6$

So the y-intercept is:

* $(0, 6)$

---

## 4. Find the Vertex

The vertex is the **turning point** of the parabola.

The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:

$x_v = -\frac{b}{2a}$

For $y = x^2 + 5x + 6$:

* $a = 1$
* $b = 5$

So:

$x$ of the vertex = $-\frac{5}{2(1)} = -2.5$


Now substitute $x = -2.5$ into the equation to find the y-coordinate:

$y$ of the vertex  = $(-2.5)^2 + 5(-2.5) + 6$

$y$ of the vertex = $6.25 - 12.5 + 6 = -0.25$

So the vertex is:

* $(-2.5, -0.25)$

---

## 5. Sketch the Graph

* The parabola opens **upward** (since $a = 1 > 0$).
* It passes through:

  * X-intercepts: $(-2, 0)$ and $(-3, 0)$
  * Y-intercept: $(0, 6)$
  * Vertex: $(-2.5, -0.25)$

**Graph summary:**

* Symmetrical U-shape.
* Axis of symmetry: $x = -2.5$.
* Lowest point (vertex): $(-2.5, -0.25)$.
