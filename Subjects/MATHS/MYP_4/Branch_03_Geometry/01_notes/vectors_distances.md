## What are vectors? 

A line segment has a length â€“ a starting point and an ending point. 

If the line segment has a **length** and a **direction** associated with it, or if it describes a movement, then we call this a **vector**. 

We can use vectors to describe movements through space, such as airplanes or drones flying through three-dimensional paths. 


There is a link between **vectors** and **pythagoras Theorem**
