- Pythagoras Theorem : In a **righ-angled triangle** the square of the **hypothenus** (longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides.
- It can be written as $a^2+ b^2 = c^2$

    - where $a$ and $b$ are the length of the shorter side
    - $c$ is the longest side (hypothenuse)
