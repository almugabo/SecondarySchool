## 1. Pythagoras Theorem 

- **Pythagoras** a Greek mathematician who liven from 580 BC to 500 BC.
- Pythagoras Theorem : In a **righ-angled triangle** the square of the **hypothenus** (longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides.
- It can be written as $a^2+ b^2 = c^2$

    - where $a$ and $b$ are the length of the shorter side
    - $c$ is the longest side (hypothenuse)

## 2. Trigonometric functions 

**Remember:** 

when you have a right-angled triangle, you can find the length of one side if you know the length of other two sides, using the **Pythagoras Theorem**

But what if you have only the length of only one side and the measurements (in degrees) of one angle ? 

In that case you can use **"TRIGONOMETRY"**

- Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with specific functions of angles and their application to calculations. 
- The word trigonometry comes from the Greek words trigonon (“triangle”) and metron (“to measure”).


To make things easier, we label each side of the a right-angled triangle as 
- **hypothenuse** : the longest side of a right-angled triangle  
- **Opposite side** : side which does not touch the angle 
- **Adjacent side** : side which is the next to the angle

In trigonometry, we have THREE main functions 

Sine (Sin)
Cosine (cos) 
Tangent (tan) 

Those three functions associate the ratio of two sides of a right-angled triangle with an angle. 

The formula of the three trigonometric functions 

*   $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
*   $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
*   $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$

an easier way to remember is to use the abbreveation SOHCAHTOA 

SOH = Sine is Opposite over Hypotenuse
CAH = Cosine is Adjacent over Hypotenuse
TOA = Tangent is Opposite over Adjacent

trigonometry is use 

- trigonometry can be used to
- calculate the numerical values of the missing parts of a triangle (or any shape that can be dissected into triangles)  when the values of other parts were given.

- and also in many other fields like astronomy, mapmaking, surveying, and artillery range finding.

## 3. Sine Rule 

The **sine rule** is a relationship between the size of an angle in a triangle and the opposing side.

We can use the sine rule to work out a missing angle or side in a triangle when we have **information about an angle and the side opposite it, and another angle and the side opposite it**.

This is the sine rule:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}
$$

or

$$
\frac{\sin(A)}{a} = \frac{\sin(B)}{b} = \frac{\sin(C)}{c}
$$

## 4. Cosine Rule 

The **cosine rule** is a formula which can be used to calculate a missing side or missing angle in a triangle.

**This is the cosine rule to find a missing side:**

$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\,\cos(A)
$$

**This is the rearranged cosine rule to find a missing angle:**

$$
\cos(A) = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}
$$
