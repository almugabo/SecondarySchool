**NB: with percentage**
*   **Think Aloud:** Verbalize your thought process. For example, for "The number of girls is 20% more than the number of boys," you could say:
    *   "Okay, 'more than' usually means addition."
    *   "'20% of the number of boys' needs to be calculated first."
    *   "Let 'b' be the number of boys. 20% of 'b' is 0.20 * b."
    *   "So, '20% more than the number of boys' is b + 0.20 * b."
    *   "We can also simplify this to 1.20 * b or 1.2b."
