## 5. Radicals and Surds 

the radical symbol =  $\sqrt{}$ 

### 5.1 Defition 

**Surd**
 - A surd is an irrational number.
 - It is any number that includes a radical symbol $\sqrt{}$ and cannot be calculated exactly

**Difference Between a Radical and a Surd:**

- **Radical:**
   A radical is a general mathematical symbol $\sqrt{}$  that denotes the root of a number or expression. It represents **any root**, whether the result is rational or irrational. 

   - **Example of a Radical:**
     $\sqrt{16} = 4$ 
     Here, $\sqrt{16}$  is a radical, and the result is a rational number.

- **Surd:**
   A surd is a specific type of radical that **cannot be simplified into a rational number**. It remains an **irrational number** after simplification. 

   - **Example of a Surd:**
     $\sqrt{5}$
  
     Here, $\sqrt{5}$ cannot be simplified further, and its decimal expansion is non-repeating and non-terminating, so it is a surd.

### Key Points:

- **All surds are radicals, but not all radicals are surds.**
- If a radical simplifies to a rational number, it is **not** a surd.
- Surds represent irrational numbers, while radicals are broader and include both rational and irrational results.

### Summary with Examples:

| **Type**    | **Example**     | **Explanation**                                |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Radical     |  $\sqrt{16}$  | Simplifies to $4$, a rational number.      |
| Surd        |  $\sqrt{7}$    | Cannot be simplified to a rational number.    |



### 5.2 Operations with Surds 


#### 5.2.1 Adding or substracting surds 

- just like with **powers** and **algebraic terms** we can and substract **like radical terms**
- **like radical terms** are those radicals that have the same number under the root (the degree of root should also be the same) 

**Example**

$\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}$ 

$\sqrt{11} + \sqrt{11} + \sqrt{11} = 3\sqrt{11}$

$5\sqrt{7} - 3\sqrt{7} = 2\sqrt{7}$ 

**BUT 

*This cannot be simplified further.***

$\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{5}$

#### 5.2.2 Multiply and Divide surds 

This works like other numbers 

$\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a . b}$ 


$\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$

#### 5.2.3 Simplifying a surd 

Simplifying a surd means rewriting it in its simplest form by ensuring that:

1. **No perfect square remains inside the radical** 
2. **number inside the radical is as small as possible**.
3. **Any fractions inside the surd are rationalized** (no surds appear in the denominator).
