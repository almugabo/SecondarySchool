## 1. Number sets

there are 6 number sets 

1. **Natural numbers $(N$)** are the counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, …  
2. **Whole numbers $(W$)** are the naturals **plus zero**: 0, 1, 2, …  
3. **Integers $(Z$)** add the negative whole numbers: … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …  
4. **Rational numbers $(Q$)** are any numbers that can be written as a fraction \$tfrac{p}{q}$.  
5. **Irrational numbers $(I$)** cannot be expressed as a fraction (e.g., \$sqrt{2}$, \$pi$).  
6. **Real numbers $(R$)** include **all** the above (both rational and irrational).  

One way to remember them : 


**"No Worries, I Rarely Ignore Reality."**

- **N** - **N**atural Numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …)  
- **W** - **W**hole Numbers (Natural Numbers + 0, e.g., 0, 1, 2, …)  
- **I** - **I**ntegers (Whole Numbers + negatives, e.g., … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …)  
- **R** - **R**ational Numbers (fractions or decimals that terminate/repeat, e.g., 1/2, -3.5, 4, …)  
- **I** - **I**rrational Numbers (non-repeating, non-terminating decimals, e.g., π, √2, …)  
- **R** - **R**eal Numbers (all Rational + Irrational numbers)

## 2. Power exponents 
| **Rule**                | **Symbolism**                     | **Example**                           | **Definition**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zero Exponent**        | $$a^0 = 1$$                       | $$2^0 = 1$$                            | Anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.                                       |
| **Negative Exponent**    | $$a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}$$        | $$2^{-5} = \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32}$$ | A negative exponent tells you that the factor is on the wrong side of the fraction bar. ($$a \neq 0$$) |
| **Product Rule**         | $$a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$$       | $$2^2 \cdot 2^3 = 2^{2+3} = 2^5 = 32$$ | When multiplying, and the bases are the same, **ADD** the exponents.          |
| **Quotient Rule**        | $$\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$$     | $$\frac{2^5}{2^2} = 2^{5-2} = 2^3 = 8$$ | When dividing, and the bases are the same, **SUBTRACT** the exponents.        |
| **Power to a Power**     | $$(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$$       | $$(2^4)^3 = 2^{4 \cdot 3} = 2^{12} = 4096$$ | When raising a power to a power, **MULTIPLY** the exponents.                  |
| **Product to a Power**   | $$(ab)^m = a^m \cdot b^m$$        | $$(3b)^3 = 3^3 \cdot b^3 = 27b^3$$     | When raising a product to a power, each factor gets raised to the new power.  |
| **Quotient to a Power**  | $$\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^m = \frac{a^m}{b^m}$$ | $$\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2^2}{3^2} = \frac{4}{9}$$ | When raising a quotient to a power, both top and bottom get raised to the new power. |
| **Fractional Exponent**  | $$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$$ | $$8^{\frac{2}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{8^2} = 4$$ | By using the fractional exponents rule, the fractional power turns into a radical. |


### some important terms 


1. **Power**:
   - A power represents the result of raising a base number to an exponent. It is the complete expression.
   - For example, in $2^3$, the power is $2^3 = 8$.

2. **Exponent**:
   - An exponent indicates how many times the base is multiplied by itself.
   - For example, in $2^3$, the exponent is $3$, which means $2 \times 2 \times 2$.

3. **Base**:
   - The base is the number that is being raised to the power of the exponent.
   - For example, in $2^3$, the base is $2$.

4. **Radical**:
   - A radical is the root of a number, often represented with the radical symbol ($\sqrt{}$).
   - For example, $\sqrt{16} = 4$ because $4^2 = 16$.

5. **Fractional Exponent**:
   - A fractional exponent combines powers and roots. The numerator of the fraction represents the power, and the denominator represents the root.
   - For example, $a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$. If $a = 8$, $m = 2$, and $n = 3$, then $8^{\frac{2}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{8^2} = 4$.

6. **Negative Exponent**:
   - A negative exponent flips the base to its reciprocal and makes the exponent positive.
   - For example, $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$. If $a = 2$ and $n = 3$, then $2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$.

7. **Zero Exponent**:
   - Any non-zero base raised to the power of zero equals $1$.
   - For example, $a^0 = 1$ (as long as $a \neq 0$).

## 5. Radicals and Surds 

the radical symbol =  $\sqrt{}$ 

### 5.1 Defition 

**Surd**
 - A surd is an irrational number.
 - It is any number that includes a radical symbol $\sqrt{}$ and cannot be calculated exactly

**Difference Between a Radical and a Surd:**

- **Radical:**
   A radical is a general mathematical symbol $\sqrt{}$  that denotes the root of a number or expression. It represents **any root**, whether the result is rational or irrational. 

   - **Example of a Radical:**
     $\sqrt{16} = 4$ 
     Here, $\sqrt{16}$  is a radical, and the result is a rational number.

- **Surd:**
   A surd is a specific type of radical that **cannot be simplified into a rational number**. It remains an **irrational number** after simplification. 

   - **Example of a Surd:**
     $\sqrt{5}$
  
     Here, $\sqrt{5}$ cannot be simplified further, and its decimal expansion is non-repeating and non-terminating, so it is a surd.

### Key Points:

- **All surds are radicals, but not all radicals are surds.**
- If a radical simplifies to a rational number, it is **not** a surd.
- Surds represent irrational numbers, while radicals are broader and include both rational and irrational results.

### Summary with Examples:

| **Type**    | **Example**     | **Explanation**                                |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Radical     |  $\sqrt{16}$  | Simplifies to $4$, a rational number.      |
| Surd        |  $\sqrt{7}$    | Cannot be simplified to a rational number.    |



### 5.2 Operations with Surds 


#### 5.2.1 Adding or substracting surds 

- just like with **powers** and **algebraic terms** we can and substract **like radical terms**
- **like radical terms** are those radicals that have the same number under the root (the degree of root should also be the same) 

**Example**

$\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}$ 

$\sqrt{11} + \sqrt{11} + \sqrt{11} = 3\sqrt{11}$

$5\sqrt{7} - 3\sqrt{7} = 2\sqrt{7}$ 

**BUT 

*This cannot be simplified further.***

$\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{5}$

#### 5.2.2 Multiply and Divide surds 

This works like other numbers 

$\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a . b}$ 


$\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$

#### 5.2.3 Simplifying a surd 

Simplifying a surd means rewriting it in its simplest form by ensuring that:

1. **No perfect square remains inside the radical** 
2. **number inside the radical is as small as possible**.
3. **Any fractions inside the surd are rationalized** (no surds appear in the denominator).
