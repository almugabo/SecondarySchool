## 5. Radicals and Surds 

the radical symbol =  $\sqrt{}$ 

### 5.1 Defition 

**Surd**
 - A surd is an irrational number.
 - It is any number that includes a radical symbol $\sqrt{}$ and cannot be calculated exactly

### 5.2 Operations with Surds 


#### 5.2.1 Adding or substracting surds 

- just like with **powers** and **algebraic terms** we can and substract **like radical terms**
- **like radical terms** are those radicals that have the same number under the root (the degree of root should also be the same) 

**Example**

$\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}$ 

$\sqrt{11} + \sqrt{11} + \sqrt{11} = 3\sqrt{11}$

$5\sqrt{7} - 3\sqrt{7} = 2\sqrt{7}$ 

**BUT 

*This cannot be simplified further.***

$\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{5}$

#### 5.2.2 Multiply and Divide surds 

This works like other numbers 

$\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a . b}$ 


$\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$

#### 5.2.3 Simplifying a surd 

Simplifying a surd means rewriting it in its simplest form by ensuring that:

1. **No perfect square remains inside the radical** 
2. **number inside the radical is as small as possible**.
3. **Any fractions inside the surd are rationalized** (no surds appear in the denominator).
