### ** Exploring Families of Lines**

**Objective:**  
Help students discover (and then state) the conditions for one solution, no solutions, and infinitely many solutions by systematically manipulating parameters in linear equations.

1. **Set up parameters with sliders**  
   - In Desmos, type:
     
     $$y = m_1x + b_1$$
     
     $$y = m_2x + b_2$$
   - Click “add slider” for each of $m_1, b_1, m_2, b_2$.  
   - This creates four sliders that students can move.

2. **Experiment and Observe**  
   - ** 2.1. Vary the Slopes**: Move $m_1$ and $m_2$ while keeping $b_1$ and $b_2$ fixed.  
     - **What do you notice if $m_1 \neq m_2$?**  
     - **How many intersection points appear on the graph?**  
   - **2.2 Same Slopes, Different Intercepts**: Try setting $m_1 = m_2$ but make $b_1 \neq b_2$  
     - **What do you notice about the lines now?**  
     - **How many intersection points appear?**  
   - **2.3. Same Slopes, Same Intercepts**: Now set $m_1 = m_2$ and $b_1 = b_2$.  
     - **What do you notice about the lines?**  
     - **How many points of intersection do they have?**  

3. **Record Your Findings**  
   Create a small table or list in which students record:  
   - **Case 1**: $m_1 \neq m_2$
   - **Case 2**: $m_1 = m_2$ but $b_1 \neq b_2$  
   - **Case 3**: $m_1 = m_2$ and $b_1 = b_2$  

   For each case, have them write:
   - **Are the lines parallel, coincident, or intersecting in exactly one point?**  
   - **How many solutions does the system have?**  

4. **Verbalize the Rule**  
   Write down in words, the “rules” you have discovered.

### Extensions and Additional Variations

1. **Challenge Extension**  
   - *create* your own pairs $m_1, b_1$ and $m_2, b_2$ that fall under each case and verify the number of solutions by looking at the graph.  
   - express each set of lines in *both* slope-intercept form and standard form. compare how the algebraic condition (e.g., same slope means same coefficients $A, B$ in standard form) matches what they see in the graph.  


2. **Three Lines**  
   Add a third line $y = m_3 x + b_3$. Ask:  
   - Under what conditions do all three lines meet at a single point (one common intersection)?  
   - Is it possible for all three lines to coincide? (Infinitely many solutions.)  
   - Can you arrange them to have no common intersection?

## Invesigation 2 

**Exercise Title:  Exploring the Impact of Coefficients on Solutions of Simultaneous Equations**

**Introduction:**

In the previous exercise, you used graphs to understand different types of solutions for simultaneous equations – one solution, no solution, and infinite solutions. Now, we will explore how changing the **coefficients** in the equations affects these solutions and the lines they represent. This exercise will help you discover the rules that determine the type of solution based on the numbers in the equations themselves.

**Instructions:**

Use algebraic manipulation and Desmos (optional for verification, but encouraged) to answer the following questions.

**Part 1:  Manipulating Coefficients for One Solution**

1. **Start with a pair of equations that have one solution:**  Let's use:
   * Equation 1:  y = x + 2
   * Equation 2:  y = -2x + 8

   a. Solve these equations simultaneously (using substitution or elimination) to find the coordinates of the intersection point.

   b. Now, **change only the coefficient of 'x' in Equation 2.** Keep the constant term (8) and the coefficient of 'x' in Equation 1 (which is 1) and the constant term in Equation 1 (which is 2) the same.  Try a few different values for the coefficient of 'x' in Equation 2 (e.g., -x, -3x, 0.5x). For each change, solve the new pair of equations and observe what happens to the solution.

   c. What do you notice about the number of solutions when you change only the coefficient of 'x' in Equation 2 (while keeping other coefficients and constants the same)?

   d. **Now, go back to the original pair of equations (y = x + 2 and y = -2x + 8). This time, change only the constant term in Equation 2.** Keep the coefficients of 'x' and 'y' the same as the original equations. Try a few different constant terms (e.g., 5, 10, 0). For each change, solve the new pair of equations and observe what happens to the solution.

   e. What do you notice about the number of solutions when you change only the constant term in Equation 2 (while keeping other coefficients the same)?

**Part 2:  Creating Equations with No Solution**

2. **Start again with Equation 1: y = x + 2.**

   a.  Think about what makes two lines parallel.  What needs to be the same about their equations? (Hint: think about slope-intercept form y = mx + c).

   b.  Write a new Equation 2 that has **the same coefficient of 'x'** as Equation 1 but a **different constant term.** For example, y = x + 5.

   c. Solve the system of equations you created in step 2b. What do you find?

   d. Graph both equations in Desmos. What do you observe about the lines?

   e.  Can you create other pairs of equations that have no solution by following a similar pattern of coefficients and constant terms? Try a few and test them.

**Part 3: Creating Equations with Infinite Solutions**

3. **Start again with Equation 1: y = x + 2.**

   a. Think about what it means for two lines to be the same line. What must be true about their equations?

   b. Write a new Equation 2 that is essentially the same as Equation 1 but looks slightly different. You can do this by multiplying Equation 1 by a constant number. For example, multiply Equation 1 by 2 to get 2y = 2x + 4.  (Rewrite this in the form y = ...).

   c. Solve the system of equations you created in step 3b. What do you find?

   d. Graph both equations in Desmos. What do you observe about the lines?

   e. Can you create other pairs of equations that have infinite solutions by following a similar pattern of manipulating Equation 1? Try a few and test them.

**Part 4:  Generalizing the Rules**

4.  Based on your observations in Parts 1, 2, and 3, try to formulate general rules about how the coefficients and constant terms in a pair of linear equations determine:

    a. When there will be **one unique solution**.  What must be different or the same about the coefficients?
    b. When there will be **no solution**. What must be the same or different about the coefficients and constant terms?
    c. When there will be **infinite solutions**. What must be the relationship between the two equations?

5. **Challenge:**  Can you express these rules using ratios of the coefficients and constant terms?  Consider the general form of linear equations:

   * Equation 1:  a₁x + b₁y = c₁
   * Equation 2:  a₂x + b₂y = c₂

   Can you find relationships between a₁, b₁, c₁, a₂, b₂, and c₂ that predict the number of solutions? (This is more advanced, but encourage students to think about it if they are ready).

## Investigation 3 

Below are two real-world scenarios (phone plans and streaming services) that translate naturally into systems of linear equations. Each scenario includes **detailed, step-by-step questions** that guide students to set up the equations, graph them, and interpret the results (one solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions) in a real-life context.

---

## **Scenario A: Choosing Between Two Phone Plans**

### **Context and Setup**

- **Plan A**: Monthly cost = \$20 + \$0.10 per minute.  
  In equation form: $C_A = 20 + 0.10x$,  
  where $x$ is the number of minutes used, and $C_A$ is the total monthly cost.

- **Plan B**: Monthly cost = \$10 + \$0.15 per minute.  
  \(\quad\)In equation form: \( C_B = 10 + 0.15x \).

### **Questions**

1. **Modeling**  
   - Write the cost equation for Plan A in terms of \(x\).  
   - Write the cost equation for Plan B in terms of \(x\).

2. **Graphing**  
   - On graph paper or using Desmos, plot both lines \(C_A\) and \(C_B\) on the same set of axes, with the horizontal axis as \(x\) (minutes) and the vertical axis as \(C\) (cost).

3. **Finding the Intersection**  
   - Solve the equations simultaneously to find the number of minutes \(x\) at which both plans cost the same (i.e., \(20 + 0.10x = 10 + 0.15x\)).  
   - Label this point \((x, C)\) on the graph and interpret what it means in real life.

4. **Interpretation**  
   - If you typically use fewer minutes than the intersection point, which plan is cheaper?  
   - If you typically use more minutes than the intersection point, which plan is cheaper?

5. **Exploring No Solution / Infinite Solutions**  
   - **No Solution**: What would happen if both plans had the *same per-minute cost* (same slope) but *different* monthly fees (different intercepts)? Write two new equations to represent that situation. Are those lines parallel on your graph?  
   - **Infinite Solutions**: Imagine both companies offer the *exact same* monthly fee and the *exact same* per-minute cost. Write that system of equations and check how many intersection points appear. Why does that make sense in a real-world context?

**Teacher Tip**:  
- This scenario typically yields **one intersection** if the two slopes (per-minute fees) are different.  
- If the slopes are the same and the base fees are different, the lines are parallel (\(\rightarrow\) **no solution**).  
- If both the slope and intercept match, you get **infinitely many solutions** (they’re the *same* plan!).

## **Scenario B: Comparing Netflix vs. Hulu**

### **Context and Setup**

- **Netflix**: A simple plan costs \$15 per month, unlimited streaming (no hourly charge).  
  $\quad$ Equation form: \( C_N = 15 \).  
- **Hulu**: A basic plan costs \$8 per month plus \$0.70 for every hour watched.  
  \(\quad\)Equation form: \( C_H = 8 + 0.70h \),  
  where \( h \) = total hours watched in the month, and \( C_H \) = total cost.

### **Questions**

1. **Modeling**  
   - Write down the equation that represents Netflix’s monthly cost (\(C_N\)).  
   - Write down the equation that represents Hulu’s monthly cost (\(C_H\)).

2. **Graphing**  
   - Plot both cost lines on the same axes: let the horizontal axis be \(h\) (hours watched) and the vertical axis be \(C\) (monthly cost).  
   - For Netflix, the graph is a *horizontal line* (no extra charge per hour).  
   - For Hulu, the graph is a line that *increases* as \(h\) increases.

3. **Finding the Intersection**  
   - Solve \(15 = 8 + 0.70h\) to see at how many hours the two services cost exactly the same.  
   - Label that intersection point \((h, C)\) on your graph.

4. **Interpretation**  
   - If you plan to watch *more* hours than the intersection point, which service becomes cheaper?  
   - If you watch *fewer* hours, which service is cheaper?

5. **Try Altering Hulu’s Pricing**  
   - Suppose Hulu changes to a *flat* \$15 monthly with *no* hourly charge. Rewrite Hulu’s equation. How does this affect the graph? How many solutions do Netflix and Hulu have now?  
   - Suppose Hulu changes to \$15 monthly plus \$1.50 per hour: \( C_H = 15 + 1.50h \). Now, compare slopes and intercepts with Netflix’s \$15 flat fee. Do these lines intersect once, never, or coincide?

6. **No Solution / Infinite Solutions Cases**  
   - **No Solution**: If both Netflix and Hulu had the *same slope* but *different* intercepts, would you ever find a point where they cost the same?  
   - **Infinite Solutions**: If Netflix and Hulu had the *exact same plan* (same intercept, same hourly rate, or no hourly rate at all), how many solutions would you see? Explain in words.
