# The Line 

## 1. introduction 

We encounter lines all the time in real life, often without even realizing it.
Think about:

- the cost of your cell phone bill increasing with each minute you use,
- the distance a car travels over time at a constant speed,
- ‚Äúgoing viral‚Äù: increase of followers over time.

These situations can be represented by lines on a graph, showing how one thing changes in relation to another.

Many of these lines ‚Äì in fact, almost all the ones we'll come across in many situations ‚Äì can be described by a special equation called the gradient-intercept form.   **ùë¶ = ùëöùë• + ùëê** (this is called the **slope-intercept form** or **gradient-intercept form**

## 2. The coordinate plane 

*Let's review the coordinate plane. It helps us draw the lines.*


A **coordinate plane** is a flat surface formed by the intersection of two lines called **AXES**. 

- the horizontal line = **X-AXIS**
- vertical line = **Y-AXIS**
- the point where they interect = **ORIGIN**

Key Facts about the **coordinate plane** is also called 

- It is also called the **cartesian plane**  or **grid system**
- it can be used to represent each point each by using a**pair of numbers** called **coordinates**
- the coordinates of a point are always given as $(X,Y)$
- It has **4** quadrants which are usually labeled **ANTI-CLOCKWISE**

## 2. slope - intercept form 

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is: 

**y = mx + c**

This equation acts like a secret code that unlocks important information about the line, telling us **how steep** it is and **where it starts** on the graph.

* **m** represents **the gradient**. (sometimes it is also called **slope** )
* **c** represents the **y-intercept**.

    ! when the equation is written in this form $Ax + By = X$ , it is said that it is written in **standard form**
       Here we deal only with the **slope-intercept form** also called **gradient-intercept** form 

## 2.1. slope as RISE OVER RUN 

- In mathematical terms, the gradient is the *change in the y-value* **divided** by *the change in the x-value* **(RISE OVER RUN)**.

## 2.2. Types of slopes or four types of gradients  


EXPLAIN !!!! 

* A **positive gradient** means the line slopes upwards from left to right.

* A **negative gradient** means the line slopes downwards from left to right.

* A **zero gradient** is horizontal. It means that the rise is **zero** and 0 divided by any number is zero

* An **undefined slope** a perfectly vertical line . It is underfined because any number divided by zero is **underfined**

## 3. find the equation of a line 

finding the equation of a line means finding:
- **m** : the slope or gradient
- **c**: the intercept

and then writing it as $y=mx+c$

There are 4 situations 

- you are given the equation in different form 
- you are given a line in coordinates system 
- you are given two points
- you are given the slope and one point

### 3.1 when given an equation in different form 

for example 

$3x + 2y = 15$ 

in that case simply **re-arrange** the equation to put it in the form $y=mx+c$ (slope-intercept form) 


```
The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is:

y = mx + b

Where:

    m is the slope of the line.

    b is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis).

Solution 

    Isolate the y term:

    Our equation is:
    3x + 2y = 15

    To isolate 2y, subtract 3x from both sides of the equation:
    2y = -3x + 15

    Solve for y:

    Divide both sides by 2 to get y alone:
    y = (-3/2)x + 15/2

Result

The equation in slope-intercept form is: y = (-3/2)x + 7.5
```


### 3.2 when given a line in coordinates system 


The first step is to find the **slope**

if you have a chart of a line, there are two ways you can **find the slope**

A) by using the chart 

![Line Plot](xCharts/chart_slope_rise_over_run_example.svg)


Chart 1: Pick Two Points

    Two points are selected on the line: A(1,2) and B(3,1).
    The line is plotted, and the points are clearly labeled.

Chart 2: Find Rise and Run

    A right triangle is drawn between the two points, illustrating the "rise" (‚àí1‚àí1) and "run" (22).
    The dashed lines highlight the vertical and horizontal distances between the points.


B) by using the **formula for the slope**

Rember slope is rise over run $\frac{rise}{run}$

Slope is calculated as:

$slope = \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$


In the example above we had two points A = (1,2) and B = (3,1)  


x | y |
--|--|
1|2|
3|1

$slope = \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} = \frac{1 - 2}{3 - 1} = \frac{-1}{2}= -\frac{1}{2}$ 

now that we have the slope $-\frac{1}{2}$ 

we need to find **c**

- we know that $y = mx + c$ 
- so $y=-\frac{1}{2}x + c$
-  we can use any of the points the line pass through to find **c**
- we just have to **plug it** into the formula

  if we take the point  $A = (1,2)$ , remember this is is $x,y$

  so IF **PLUG** the values in the equation we get 

  $2 = -\frac{1}{2} + c$

  we isolate c

  $2 + -\frac{1}{2} = c$

  $2 -0.5 = c$

  $c = 1.5$

  so for this line

  $m=-\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=1.5$

  so the equation of the line is

  $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 1.5$


### 3.3 when you are given two points 

when you are given two points 
- first find **m** by using the **formula for the slope**
- second : find **c** by **pluging the values of one point** into the equation of the line $y=mx+c$

example:

**find the equation of a line which passes through two points A=(2,4) and B= (5,10)**

**Step 1: find m**

point|  x | y |
--|--|--|
A|2|4|
B|5|10|

remember the formula of the slope :

$slope = m = \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} $ 

$m = \frac{10-4}{5 - 2} = \frac{6}{3}= 2$

$m=2$

**Step 2: find c** by **PLUGING IN THE VALUES OF ONE POINT**

the equation of the line $y=mx+c$

m = 2 

y = 2x + c 

to find c we can use point A=(2,4) or B= (5,10)

we use point B



in point B : x = 5, y = 10 

4 = 2 * 5 + c 

4 = 10 + c 

we isolate c 

4-10 = c 

-6 = c 

so c = -6 

we have m = 2 and c = -6 

so the equation of the line is $y = 2x - 6$

### 3.3 when you are one point and the slope 

that means you have **m** and just have to find **c**

example:

**find the equation of a line which passes through the point (4,6) and has a slope of -3**

equation of a line is $y=mx + c$

**m= -3**

the task is to find **c** by **PLUGING IN THE VALUES OF ONE POINT**

x = 4 and y = 6 

so 
6 = -3 * 4 + c 

6 = -12 + c 

we isolate c 

6 + 12 = c 

c = 18 

with m = -3 and c = 18 the equation of the line is 

$y = -3x + 18$
