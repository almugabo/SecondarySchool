## 1. Intro 

- Moving just means going from a position to another (one point to another)
- Motion = **change of position**

- when we move, we cover a **distance** i.e. the length between one point to another
- **distance** = measurement of how parts two points/two objects are from each other , are far apart


## 2. Distance and Displacement 


### Example 1 

Imagine an ant is trying to reach a drop of honey. It doesn't walk in a straight line. It walks around pebbles, over twigs, and maybe even takes a detour to avoid a spider!


![Line Plot](Charts/unit_motion_distance_displacement_01.svg)

1) how many total segments does the ant's path have?
2) In which directions does the ant move during its journey?
3) What is the total distance traveled by the ant?
4) What is the starting point of the ant? What is the ending point?
5) Compare the total distance the ant traveled with the straight-line displacement. Which is larger? Why?
6) If the ant walks in a square and returns to its starting point
   - a) what would its displacement be?
   - b) What would its total distance be?
8) Can displacement ever be greater than distance? Why or why not ?



### Example 2

Below is a movement of cat in meters. The cat starts at some position (initial) and moves to another position (final).

![Line Plot](Charts/unit_motion_distance_displacement_02.svg)

a) What is the initial position of the cat?
b) What is the final position of the cat?
c) If the cat travelled in a straight line from the initial to the final position, what distance did it travel?
d) If the cat travelled in a straight line from the initial to the final position, what is its displacement ?

**REMEMBER**

**Distance**: The total length of the path traveled by an object. It's a scalar quantity, meaning it only has magnitude (a numerical value). Think of it as the reading on your car's odometer.

**Displacement**: The change in position of an object. It's a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. It's the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points, with a direction. Imagine drawing a straight arrow from where you started to where you finished.



- When talking about **distance** we only state the *numerical value*
  
• for example: 14 cm and not 14 centimeters northeast or anything like that).
         
• This means we have only one value, *the magnitude*. This type of values is called a **scalar**. 

- When talking about **displacement**, we state the  *numerical value* and also add the *direction*
  
• for example: 7 centimeters northeast of its starting point
         
• So, we have two values: the *magnitude and the direction*. This type of values is called a **vector**.

## 3. Speed and Velocity 

#### Speed 
- Speed is a measeure of how fast you are going
- When we talk about speed we specify which distance something is traveling in a given amount of time.
- For example , imagine a cheetah chasing a gazelle. We can say that cheetah runs 100 meters in 4 seconds.

$Speed = \frac{Distance}{Time}$ 

in this case 

$\text{Speed of the cheetah}= \frac{Distance}{Time} = \frac{100 m}{4 seconds} = 25 meters per second (m/s)$ 


#### Velocity 
As we have distance and displacement, we also have Speed and Velocity 

**Velocity: Speed with a Direction** 

The Airplane's Flight: Now, consider an airplane flying. Let's say it's traveling at 600 kilometers per hour (km/h).

"Is this enough information to fully describe the airplane's motion?"

-  knowing only the speed isn't enough.
-  We also need to know the direction. Is it flying north, south, east, or west?


- Speed is a scalar quantity – it only has magnitude (25 m/s in this case) and no direction. 
- Velocity is a vector quantity – it has both magnitude (600 km/h) and direction (east).


$Velocity = \frac{Displacement}{Time}$ 


## 4. Acceleration 


When people run, fall, cycle or travel in a car or a plane their speed will change. 

**Acceleration**  is the change of velocity by time taken. 

It is the amount that velocity changes per unit time.

$\text{acceleration} = \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time taken}}$

$\alpha = \frac{v-u}{t}$

where 

- acceleration ($\alpha$) is measured in metres per second squared (m/s2)
- change in velocity (v - u) is measured in metres per second (m/s)
- time taken (t) is measured in seconds (s)

If an object is 
- speeding up (**acceleration**)
- slowing down (**deceleration**) .*its acceleration has a negative value*

## 5. Time Distance Graph 


Graphs can help us study motion 

here are some data about a race by Usain Bolt 

distance_data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
time_data = [1.88, 2.88, 3.78, 4.64, 5.47, 6.29, 7.1, 7.92, 8.74, 9.58]


here if we show the data as a GIF
