### Question 1: 

**Use the terms in the vocabulary box to fill in the blanks for the following sentences. Each term may be used more than once.**

Vocabulary: Action-at-a-distance; Contact; Elastic; Electrostatic; Force; Friction; Gravitational; Magnetic ; Tension
- A(n) --------------------- is a push or a pull that acts on an object.  
- --------------------- forces only have an effect on objects that they touch.  
- ------------------------ forces act on an object without touching them.  
- ----------------------- works to slow down or stop motion due to surfaces rubbing against each other.  
- A(n)------------------------ force is experienced by a rope when it is pulled at either end.  
- When a spring returns to its normal shape. These are examples of ----------------- forces.  
- A(n) ----------------------- force pulls objects toward each other because they have mass.  
- A(n) --------------------- force pulls or pushes on metals such as iron.  
- A(n) ---------------------- force causes pushing and pulling forces due to differences in charge of the small particles that make up matter.  
These are examples of ------------------ forces.

## SOLUTIONS 

**Solutions to Force Type Questions**

**Question 1: Fill-in-the-Blanks**

*   A(n) **Force** is a push or a pull that acts on an object.
*   **Contact** forces only have an effect on objects that they touch.
*   **Action-at-a-distance** forces act on an object without touching them.
*   **Friction** works to slow down or stop motion due to surfaces rubbing against each other.
*   A(n) **Tension** force is experienced by a rope when it is pulled at either end.
*   When a spring returns to its normal shape. These are examples of **Elastic** forces.
*   A(n) **Gravitational** force pulls objects toward each other because they have mass.
*   A(n) **Magnetic** force pulls or pushes on metals such as iron.
*   A(n) **Electrostatic** force causes pushing and pulling forces due to differences in charge of the small particles that make up matter.
*   These are examples of **Action-at-a-distance** forces. *(Referring to Gravitational, Magnetic, Electrostatic forces mentioned just before)*

**Question 2: Matching Descriptors to Forces**

*   **F. Gravitational** - An apple falls from a tree branch *(Gravity pulls the apple down)*
*   **B. Tension** - A person uses a rope to pull a friend on a sled *(Force transmitted through the rope)*
*   **D. Magnetic** - A magnet holds a picture on a fridge *(Force exerted by the magnet)*
*   **A. Elastic** - A person pulls a bow back and shoots the arrow *(Stretched bow exerts a restoring force)*
*   **E. Electrostatic** - A sock is stuck to a sweater as it comes out of the dryer *(Static cling due to charge buildup)*
*   **C. Friction** - When a person stops pedalling, the bicycle slows down *(Friction/air resistance oppose motion)*
*   **F. Gravitational** - A meteor travelling through space moves faster and faster as it approaches Earth *(Earth's gravity pulls the meteor)*
*   **A. Elastic** - A bungee cord pulls a jumper back up toward the platform from which he jumped *(Stretched cord exerts a restoring force)*
*   **C. Friction** - Your hands become warmer as you vigorously rub them together *(Friction generates heat)*
*   **E. Electrostatic** - When combing your hair, you notice hairs move outward from your head toward the comb *(Static charge causes attraction/repulsion)*
