## Velocity time graphs 

**The Walk to School**

A student starts from home and walks at a constant speed of 1.5 m/s for 5 minutes. They then stop for 2 minutes to tie a shoelace. After that, they walk at a speed of 2 m/s for another 3 minutes until they reach school.

**The Bus Journey**

A bus starts from rest and accelerates at a constant rate until it reaches a speed of 15 m/s in 10 seconds. It then travels at this constant speed for 30 seconds. Finally, it decelerates to a stop in 15 seconds.

**The Jog and Sprint**

A person begins a jog at a constant speed for 10 minutes. They then increase their speed gradually over 5 minutes until they reach a sprint speed. They then maintain that sprint speed for 3 minutes, before slowing down to a complete stop over 2 minutes.

**The Elevator Ride**

An elevator starts at rest on the ground floor, accelerates upwards at a constant rate for 3 seconds until it reaches a velocity of 5 m/s, then travels at a constant speed for 10 seconds, then decelerates to a stop at the next floor in 4 seconds.

**The Toy Car Race**

A toy car is pushed to start a race. Initially, it accelerates rapidly to a constant velocity. Then it travels at this constant velocity. After a while, the car starts to slow down at the same rate it accelerated, and comes to a halt.
