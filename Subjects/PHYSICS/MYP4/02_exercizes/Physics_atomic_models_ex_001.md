1. Compare and contrast Democritus' and Dalton's views of the atom. How were they similar and different?
2. Thomson's model of the atom is often called the _______________ model.
3. Rutherford's gold foil experiment led to the discovery of the ______, which surprised him because most alpha particles ______.
4. What was the main contribution of Bohr to atomic theory that built upon Rutherford's model?

5. Why was Rutherford surprised when some alpha particles bounced back from the gold foil?
6. What were the two main conclusions Rutherford made from his experiment regarding
   - The mass of what was deflecting the particles
   - The size of what was deflecting the particles

6. Match the particle with its characteristics:
   - Has a positive charge
   - Has no charge but adds mass
   - Is negatively charged and found in orbits
   - Is located in the nucleus
   - defines the element
   - It contributes most to the mass of an atom.
   - It was discovered by J.J. Thomson.

7. True or False: The nucleus contains most of the atom's mass but takes up most of the atom's space.
8. Why does an atom have a neutral charge overall? Explain using the concepts of protons and electrons.

9. The ___________ uniquely determines which element an atom is.
10. Using the simplified atomic notation analyze the helium atom (₂⁴He) and determine:
   - Number of protons
   - Number of neutrons
   - Number of electrons
11. True or False: Changing the number of neutrons in an atom changes it into a different element.

12. What makes isotopes of the same element different from each other?
13. Looking at the oxygen isotopes shown in the document, explain why they all have the same chemical properties despite having different masses.
14  Complete this table for Oxygen-16, Oxygen-17, and Oxygen-18:

   Element | Number of protons | Number of neutrons | Number of electrons

15. For each description, identify whether it matches Democritus, Dalton, Thomson, Rutherford, or Bohr:
- Proposed that matter couldn't be divided indefinitely
- Discovered that atoms have a dense, positive nucleus
- Suggested that electrons move in fixed energy levels
- Found negatively charged particles in atoms
- Proved that compounds contain elements in fixed ratios

16. **True or False:** Democritus conducted experiments to prove the existence of atoms.
17. Democritus called the smallest particles of matter _______________, which means "uncuttable" in Greek.
18. How did Dalton's experiments with compounds contribute to the understanding of atoms?  Give an example.

19. Thomson's model of the atom is often called the _______________ model.
20. How did Thomson explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, given his discovery of negatively charged electrons?

21. Explain the setup and results of Rutherford's gold foil experiment.
22. **True or False:** Rutherford expected most of the alpha particles to bounce back from the gold foil.
23. **Fill in the blank:** Rutherford's experiment led to the discovery of the _______________, the dense, positively charged center of the atom.

24.  **True or False:**  Rutherford's model completely explained how electrons occupied the space around the nucleus.

25.  **List and briefly describe two major models of the atom that have changed over time.** Include the names of the scientists associated with the models if you can.

26. **Explain why models in science, such as the atomic model, are revised over time.** Think about what happens when new information is discovered through experiments.
