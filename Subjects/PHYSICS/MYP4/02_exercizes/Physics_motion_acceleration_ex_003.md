# Solutions 


### Review of the basic concepts of motion and acceleration.

**1. Displacement and Distance:**

*   **Distance:** The total length of the path traveled by an object. It's a scalar quantity, meaning it only has magnitude (size). For example, if you walk 5 meters and then walk back 2 meters, the total distance you traveled is 7 meters.
*   **Displacement:** The change in position of an object from its starting point. It's a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. In the same example, if you walk 5 meters forward and then 2 meters back, your displacement from the starting point is 3 meters forward.

**2. Velocity and Speed:**

*   **Speed:** The rate at which an object covers distance. It's a scalar quantity.  Average speed is calculated as:
    **Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time**
*   **Velocity:** The rate at which an object changes its displacement. It's a vector quantity. Average velocity is calculated as:
    **Average Velocity = Total Displacement / Total Time**
    For constant velocity (uniform motion), velocity is simply Displacement / Time.

**3. Acceleration:**

*   **Acceleration:** The rate of change of velocity. It's a vector quantity.  If an object's velocity changes, it is accelerating.
    **Acceleration = Change in Velocity / Time taken for the change**
    Mathematically, if the initial velocity is $u$ and the final velocity is $v$ after a time $t$, then the acceleration $a$ is given by:
    **$a = \frac{v - u}{t}$**
*   **Units of Acceleration:**  The standard unit of acceleration is meters per second squared ($\text{m/s}^2$). This means the velocity is changing by so many meters per second, every second.

**4. Uniform Acceleration (Constant Acceleration):**

In many of these problems, we assume uniform acceleration. This means the acceleration is constant and doesn't change over time.  For uniform acceleration in a straight line, we use the following equations of motion (also known as SUVAT equations):

*   **$v = u + at$**  (relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time)
*   **$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$** (relates displacement, initial velocity, acceleration, and time)
*   **$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$** (relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and displacement)
*   **$s = \frac{(u+v)}{2}t$** (relates displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, and time)

Where:
*   $u$ = initial velocity
*   $v$ = final velocity
*   $a$ = acceleration
*   $t$ = time
*   $s$ = displacement

**5. Free Fall:**

*   Free fall is the motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone. Near the Earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately constant and is denoted by $g$. The standard value of $g$ on Earth is approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$ downwards.  On other celestial bodies, like the Moon Io, the value of $g$ will be different.
