### Q06
The driver of a car increased the speed of the car as it joined the motorway. It then traveled at constant velocity before slowing down as it left the motorway at the next junction.  
   - i) When did the car decelerate?  
   - ii) When was the acceleration of the car zero?  
   - iii) When the car joined the motorway, it accelerated from a speed of $7.0 \, \text{m/s}$ for $10 \, \text{s}$ at an acceleration of $2.0 \, \text{m/s}^2$. Calculate its speed at the end of this time.

### Q07
4. A sprinter in a $100 \, \text{m}$ race accelerated from rest and reached a speed of $9.2 \, \text{m/s}$ in the first $3.1 \, \text{s}$.  
   **a)** Calculate the acceleration of the sprinter in this time.  
   **b)** The sprinter continued to accelerate to top speed and completed the race in $10.4 \, \text{s}$. Calculate the sprinter’s average speed.
