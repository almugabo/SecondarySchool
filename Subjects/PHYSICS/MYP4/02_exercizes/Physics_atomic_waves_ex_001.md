**Exercise 1: Understanding Waves**
1. Define mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves. Provide one example of each.
2. Explain the difference between transverse and longitudinal waves. Illustrate your answer with simple diagrams of each type.

---

**Exercise 2: Wave Equations**
1. Write the formula that relates wave speed (\(v\)), frequency (\(f\)), and wavelength (\(\lambda\)).
   - Define each term in the formula.
2. A wave has a frequency of 8 Hz and a wavelength of 3 m. Calculate its speed.

**Exercise 3: Frequency and Period**
1. A pendulum swings back and forth 15 times in 30 seconds.
   - (a) What is the frequency of the pendulum's motion?
   - (b) What is the period of one swing?

**Exercise 5: Comparing Sound and Light Waves**
1. Explain how sound waves differ from light waves in terms of:
   - (a) The medium required for travel.
   - (b) Their speed in different materials.
2. Why does light travel faster in air than sound does?

**Exercise 6: Wave Graph Analysis**
Use a graph of water depth similar to the one provided:
1. Identify the wavelength of the wave from the graph.
2. Determine the amplitude of the wave.
3. If the wave speed is 1.5 m/s, calculate how long it takes for one wave to pass a point.

**Exercise 7: Wave Speed in Materials**
Given the table of sound speeds in different materials:
1. In which material does sound travel the fastest? Why?
2. How does the density of a material affect the speed of sound? Explain your reasoning.
