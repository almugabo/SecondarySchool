### Practice Exercises: Section 3.2 - Resultant Force (Continued)

**Instructions:** For each problem, determine the **magnitude** (size) and **direction** of the resultant force acting *horizontally* on the main object. State whether the horizontal forces are **balanced** or **unbalanced**.

**Exercise 1: Pushing a Desk** (From previous response, for completeness)

*   You push a desk to the right with 50 N. Your friend pushes right with 40 N. Friction pushes left with 15 N.
    *   **Calculate:** What is the magnitude and direction of the resultant force on the desk?
    *   **Analyze:** Are the forces balanced or unbalanced?

**Exercise 2: Tug-of-War**

*   Two teams are playing tug-of-war. Team Alpha pulls to the left with a force of 350 N. Team Bravo pulls to the right with a force of 380 N.

    *   *(Visualize: Draw a rope. Arrow left labeled 350 N. Arrow right labeled 380 N.)*
    *   **Calculate:** What is the magnitude and direction of the resultant force on the rope?
    *   **Analyze:** Are the forces balanced or unbalanced? Which team is likely winning at this instant?

**Exercise 3: The Skater**

*   A skater is moving across the ice. Let's consider the horizontal forces. The skater generates a forward push (thrust) of **120 N** by pushing against the ground/ice. Combined forces of air resistance and friction act against the skater's motion with a total force of **35 N**. *(We are interpreting the 120 N push against the ground as the action, resulting in a 120 N reaction force from the ground pushing the skater forward. We will ignore the separate "100 N push" mentioned in the description for this version to avoid confusion, assuming the 120 N is the relevant forward thrust).*

    *   *(Visualize: Draw a point/box for the skater. Draw an arrow forward labeled 120 N. Draw an arrow backward labeled 35 N.)*
    *   **Calculate:** What is the magnitude and direction of the resultant horizontal force acting on the skater?
    *   **Analyze:** Are the horizontal forces balanced or unbalanced? What will happen to the skater's speed as a result of this net force?
----
**Exercise 4: Lifting a Bucket**

*   You are lifting a bucket of water straight up using a rope. The rope pulls upwards with a tension force of 60 N. The weight of the bucket (gravity pulling down) is 45 N.

    *   *(Visualize: Draw a bucket. Draw an arrow upwards labeled 60 N. Draw an arrow downwards labeled 45 N.)*
    *   **Calculate:** What is the magnitude and direction of the resultant force on the bucket?
    *   **Analyze:** Are the forces balanced or unbalanced? If the bucket was initially at rest, what will happen to it?
----
**Exercise 5: Constant Velocity Glider**

*   A glider on an air track (where friction is negligible) is pushed briefly and then moves along the track to the right at a **constant velocity**. Air resistance provides a tiny force of 0.5 N to the left.

    *   *(Think: What does "constant velocity" tell you about the forces according to Newton's First Law?)*
    *   **Analyze:** What *must* be the resultant force acting on the glider? Are the forces balanced or unbalanced? If there is a 0.5 N force to the left, what other horizontal force (if any) must be acting?
