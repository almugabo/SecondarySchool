**Instructions:** For each problem, determine the **magnitude** (size) and **direction** of the resultant force acting *horizontally* on the main object. State whether the horizontal forces are **balanced** or **unbalanced**.

**Exercise 1: Pushing a Desk** (From previous response, for completeness)

*   You push a desk to the right with 50 N. Your friend pushes right with 40 N. Friction pushes left with 15 N.
    *   **Calculate:** What is the magnitude and direction of the resultant force on the desk?
    *   **Analyze:** Are the forces balanced or unbalanced?

**Exercise 2: Tug-of-War**

*   Two teams are playing tug-of-war. Team Alpha pulls to the left with a force of 350 N. Team Bravo pulls to the right with a force of 380 N.

    *   *(Visualize: Draw a rope. Arrow left labeled 350 N. Arrow right labeled 380 N.)*
    *   **Calculate:** What is the magnitude and direction of the resultant force on the rope?
    *   **Analyze:** Are the forces balanced or unbalanced? Which team is likely winning at this instant?

**Exercise 3: The Skater**

*   A skater is moving across the ice. Let's consider the horizontal forces. The skater generates a forward push (thrust) of **120 N** by pushing against the ground/ice. Combined forces of air resistance and friction act against the skater's motion with a total force of **35 N**. *(We are interpreting the 120 N push against the ground as the action, resulting in a 120 N reaction force from the ground pushing the skater forward. We will ignore the separate "100 N push" mentioned in the description for this version to avoid confusion, assuming the 120 N is the relevant forward thrust).*

    *   *(Visualize: Draw a point/box for the skater. Draw an arrow forward labeled 120 N. Draw an arrow backward labeled 35 N.)*
    *   **Calculate:** What is the magnitude and direction of the resultant horizontal force acting on the skater?
    *   **Analyze:** Are the horizontal forces balanced or unbalanced? What will happen to the skater's speed as a result of this net force?

**Exercise 4: Lifting a Bucket**

*   You are lifting a bucket of water straight up using a rope. The rope pulls upwards with a tension force of 60 N. The weight of the bucket (gravity pulling down) is 45 N.

    *   *(Visualize: Draw a bucket. Draw an arrow upwards labeled 60 N. Draw an arrow downwards labeled 45 N.)*
    *   **Calculate:** What is the magnitude and direction of the resultant force on the bucket?
    *   **Analyze:** Are the forces balanced or unbalanced? If the bucket was initially at rest, what will happen to it?
----
**Exercise 5: Constant Velocity Glider**

*   A glider on an air track (where friction is negligible) is pushed briefly and then moves along the track to the right at a **constant velocity**. Air resistance provides a tiny force of 0.5 N to the left.

    *   *(Think: What does "constant velocity" tell you about the forces according to Newton's First Law?)*
    *   **Analyze:** What *must* be the resultant force acting on the glider? Are the forces balanced or unbalanced? If there is a 0.5 N force to the left, what other horizontal force (if any) must be acting?

### Solutions to Practice Exercises: Section 3.2 - Resultant Force

**Exercise 1: Pushing a Desk**

*   **Forces Involved:**
    *   Your push: 50 N to the right (+50 N)
    *   Friend's push: 40 N to the right (+40 N)
    *   Friction: 15 N to the left (-15 N)
*   **Calculate Resultant Force (F<sub>net</sub>):**
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = (+50 N) + (+40 N) + (-15 N)
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = +90 N - 15 N
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = +75 N
*   **Magnitude and Direction:** The resultant force is **75 N to the right**.
*   **Balanced or Unbalanced?** The resultant force is not zero (75 N ≠ 0 N), so the forces are **unbalanced**.
*   **Consequence:** Because there is a net force to the right, the desk will accelerate to the right (Newton's Second Law).

**Exercise 2: Tug-of-War**

*   **Forces Involved:**
    *   Team Alpha's pull: 350 N to the left (-350 N)
    *   Team Bravo's pull: 380 N to the right (+380 N)
*   **Calculate Resultant Force (F<sub>net</sub>):**
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = (-350 N) + (+380 N)
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = +30 N
*   **Magnitude and Direction:** The resultant force is **30 N to the right**.
*   **Balanced or Unbalanced?** The resultant force is not zero (30 N ≠ 0 N), so the forces are **unbalanced**.
*   **Analysis:** Team Bravo is pulling with slightly more force. The net force is in their direction, so the rope (and the teams) will accelerate to the right. Team Bravo is likely winning at this instant.

**Exercise 3: The Skater**

*   **Forces Involved (Horizontal):**
    *   Forward push from ice/ground (Reaction to skater pushing): 120 N forward (let's say right: +120 N)
    *   Air resistance and friction: 35 N backward (left: -35 N)
*   **Calculate Resultant Force (F<sub>net</sub>):**
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = (+120 N) + (-35 N)
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = +85 N
*   **Magnitude and Direction:** The resultant horizontal force is **85 N forward** (in the direction the skater is trying to go).
*   **Balanced or Unbalanced?** The resultant force is not zero (85 N ≠ 0 N), so the horizontal forces are **unbalanced**.
*   **Analysis:** Because there is a net forward force, the skater will accelerate forward (speed up or continue speeding up).

**Exercise 4: Lifting a Bucket**

*   **Forces Involved (Vertical):**
    *   Tension in rope: 60 N upwards (+60 N)
    *   Weight of bucket (gravity): 45 N downwards (-45 N)
*   **Calculate Resultant Force (F<sub>net</sub>):**
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = (+60 N) + (-45 N)
    *   F<sub>net</sub> = +15 N
*   **Magnitude and Direction:** The resultant force is **15 N upwards**.
*   **Balanced or Unbalanced?** The resultant force is not zero (15 N ≠ 0 N), so the forces are **unbalanced**.
*   **Analysis:** Since there is a net upward force, the bucket will accelerate upwards. If it was initially at rest, it will start moving upwards with increasing speed.

**Exercise 5: Constant Velocity Glider**

*   **Key Information:** The glider moves at **constant velocity**.
*   **Apply Newton's First Law:** An object moving at constant velocity has zero acceleration.
*   **Apply Newton's Second Law (F<sub>net</sub> = ma):** If the acceleration (a) is zero, then the net force (F<sub>net</sub>) must also be zero. (F<sub>net</sub> = m * 0 = 0 N).
*   **Magnitude and Direction:** The resultant force *must* be **0 N**.
*   **Balanced or Unbalanced?** Because the resultant force is zero, the forces are **balanced**.
*   **Analysis:** The problem states there is air resistance of 0.5 N to the left. For the forces to be balanced (and the velocity to be constant), there *must* be another force acting on the glider that is exactly 0.5 N to the right to cancel out the air resistance. In a typical idealized physics problem, we might assume air resistance is negligible *if* constant velocity is stated. However, if air resistance *is* stated as 0.5 N *and* velocity is constant, it implies an unmentioned forward force (like a tiny continuous push or tilt in the track) is also present, balancing it perfectly. The most direct answer based *solely* on "constant velocity" is that F<sub>net</sub> = 0 N and forces are balanced.
