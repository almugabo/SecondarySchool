A snail starts crawling from a tree. It moves at a steady pace, covering 20 centimeters in the first 4 minutes. It then stops to eat a leaf for 3 minutes. The snail then continues to crawl, covering another 10 centimeters in 2 minutes. After that, it remains stationary for 5 minutes.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the snail's journey.**

A drone takes off from the ground, rising 50 meters in the first 10 seconds. It hovers at that height for 5 seconds, then climbs another 100 meters in 15 seconds. It remains at that altitude for 20 seconds and then is landed in 5 seconds.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the drone's flight.**

A cat walks from its home to a neighbor’s house, moving at a consistent pace, covering 100 meters in 5 minutes. The cat stays there for 3 minutes, then returns home at the same pace.

**Task:  Draw a distance-time graph to show the cat's trip.**

A student walks to school. In the first 8 minutes, they walk 600 meters. They then slow down for the next 4 minutes and walk only 200 meters more. The student remains stationary for 2 minutes, waiting for a friend.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the student's journey.**

A robot travels in a straight line, covering 3 meters in 2 seconds. Then, it rests for 1 second. Next, it moves 5 meters in 2 seconds. Finally, it stays idle for 2 seconds before being turned off.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the robot's movement.**

A climber ascends a rock face, reaching 15 meters in the first 25 minutes. They take a 10-minute break, then continue climbing to 30 meters in the next 30 minutes. Then they descend to the base at the same speed as the climb.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the climber's ascent and descent.**

---

A balloon is released. It floats upwards, reaching 40 meters in the first 3 minutes. It then rises an additional 60 meters in the next 6 minutes. The balloon then floats at that height for 4 minutes, and then is deflated in 2 minutes and falls to the ground.

**Task:  Draw a distance-time graph to show the balloon's journey.**

---

A tortoise walks a short path, covering 20 meters in the first 10 minutes, then stays still for another 5 minutes and completes the walk with a new 10-meter path in 5 minutes.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the tortoise’s journey.**

---

A paper airplane flies 15 meters in 3 seconds, then it is caught in the wind and drifts 2 meters in 4 seconds. The plane then sits stationary for 5 seconds on a tree.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the paper airplane's flight.**

---

A squirrel runs 30 meters up a tree in 12 seconds, pauses for 4 seconds, then climbs down the same distance in 8 seconds and rests at the base for another 10 seconds.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the squirrel's movement.**

Sophia rode her bike to post a letter. She left home and cycled at a constant speed for 2 minutes, traveling 300 meters. Sophia was stationary for 1 minute before continuing her journey, traveling for a further 2 minutes. Sophia was now 500 meters from home. She remained stationary for 2 minutes while she posted the letter and rested. Sophia returned home, cycling at a constant speed. The total journey was 12 minutes.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show Sophia's journey.**

---

An otter swims 100 meters in 30 seconds before they get tired and drift along 75 meters in 40 seconds. The otter then relaxes on the riverbank for 10 seconds.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show the otter's journey.**

---

A child lets go of a balloon. In the first 5 minutes, the balloon rises 100 meters. In the next 10 minutes, it rises a further 50 meters. The balloon then begins to fall at a constant speed. The balloon returns to its original position 60 minutes after the child had let go of it.

**Task: Draw a distance-time graph to show this information.**
