**Experiment Example 1:  "Investigating the Effect of Ramp Angle on Marble Distance"**

**Scenario:** A student wants to investigate how the angle of a ramp affects how far a marble rolls after it leaves the ramp. They use a wooden ramp, a marble, a protractor to measure the ramp angle, and a ruler to measure the distance the marble travels horizontally after leaving the ramp. They test ramp angles of 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 40 degrees, releasing the marble from the same point on the ramp each time.

**Now, think about these questions for this experiment:**
- a) Formulate a hypothesis for this investigation.
- b) What is the independent variable?
- c) Explain the dependent variable and how it might be measured.
- d) Identify two suitable control variables and how they could be kept constant.
- e) Suggest an appropriate type of graph to present the relationship between ramp angle and marble distance.

**Experiment Example 2: "Investigating the Effect of Light Color on Plant Growth"**

**Scenario:** A student wants to see if different colors of light affect how well bean plants grow. They set up four groups of bean plants, all the same type and size.  Each group is placed under a different colored light bulb (red, blue, green, and white - which is our 'control' of normal light). They make sure all plants get the same amount of water and are in the same type of soil and pots.  They measure the height of the plants after two weeks.

**Think about these questions:**

- a) Formulate a hypothesis for this investigation.
- b) What is the independent variable?
- c) Explain the dependent variable and how it might be measured.
- d) Identify two suitable control variables and how they could be kept constant.
- e) Suggest an appropriate type of graph to present the relationship between light color and plant height.

**Experiment Example 3: "Investigating the Effect of Salt Concentration on Brine Shrimp Hatching Rate"**

**Scenario:** A student is curious about how salty water needs to be for brine shrimp eggs to hatch best. They prepare five petri dishes, each with the same amount of water, but with different concentrations of salt (0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% salt solutions). They add the same number of brine shrimp eggs to each dish and place them all in the same location with the same temperature and light. After 48 hours, they count how many brine shrimp eggs have hatched in each dish.

**Think about these questions:**

- a) Formulate a hypothesis for this investigation.
- b) What is the independent variable?
- c) Explain the dependent variable and how it might be measured.
- d) Identify two suitable control variables and how they could be kept constant.
- e) Suggest an appropriate type of graph to present the relationship between salt concentration and hatching rate.

**Experiment Example 4: "Investigating the Effect of Insulation on Cooling Rate of Hot Water"**

**Scenario:** A student wants to test how different types of insulation affect how quickly hot water cools down. They take four identical cups and wrap each one in a different material: no insulation (control), paper towel, aluminum foil, and bubble wrap. They pour the same amount of hot water (at the same starting temperature) into each cup. They measure the temperature of the water in each cup every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.

**Think about these questions:**

- a) Formulate a hypothesis for this investigation.
- b) What is the independent variable?
- c) Explain the dependent variable and how it might be measured.
- d) Identify two suitable control variables and how they could be kept constant.
- e) Suggest an appropriate type of graph to present the relationship between insulation type and water temperature over time. (Think about how temperature changes *over time* - might a line graph be useful here?)

**Experiment Example 5: "Investigating the Effect of Exercise Type on Heart Rate Increase"**

**Scenario:** A student wants to investigate which type of exercise causes the biggest increase in heart rate. They have participants perform three different exercises for 5 minutes each:  running in place, jumping jacks, and brisk walking.  Before and immediately after each exercise, they measure the participant's heart rate (beats per minute). They use the same participants for all three exercises, with rest periods in between.

**Think about these questions:**

- a) Formulate a hypothesis for this investigation.
- b) What is the independent variable?
- c) Explain the dependent variable and how it might be measured.
- d) Identify two suitable control variables and how they could be kept constant.
- e) Suggest an appropriate type of graph to present the relationship between exercise type and heart rate increase.
