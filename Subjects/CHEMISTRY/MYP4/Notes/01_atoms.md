## 1. Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter

### 1. definition 

 An atom is the smallest unit of an element that retains the chemical properties of that element.

### 2. Structure of an atom 

Atoms are composed of **three main types of subatomic particles**: protons, neutrons, and electrons. 


1.	**Protons** have a positive charge and are located in the nucleus. They help define what element an atom is—for example, an atom with one proton is hydrogen, while an atom with six protons is carbon.
2.	**Neutrons** have no charge but add mass to the atom. They are also located in the nucleus. Atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons, which are called isotopes. For instance, most carbon atoms have six neutrons, but some have seven or eight.
3.	**Electrons** are negatively charged and are found outside the nucleus. They are much smaller and lighter than protons or neutrons. The arrangement of electrons in an atom determines how it will interact with other atoms—this is the basis of chemical reactions.

Note:
 - The atom as whole has a **neutral charge**, so it means that it has the same number of electrons (negative) and protons (positive). They cancel each other out 
 - The **nucleus** of is region in the middle of the atom. It contains essentially all the mass of an atom, but it is tiny, about a hundred thousand times smaller than the whole atom.

### 3. Size of an atom and sub-particle 

- Atoms are very small. Typical atoms have a radius of about 0.1 nm (0.0000000001 m, that is 1 × 10^−10 m). **nm=nanometers**
- The nucleus is tiny compared to the size of the atom as a whole. The radius of the nucleus is less than 1/10000th of that of the atom (1 × 10^−14 m). This difference in size between a nucleus and an atom is equivalent to a pea placed in the middle of a football pitch .
- The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. These are much heavier than electrons. This means that most of the mass of the atom is contained in the tiny nucleus in the middle.

#### Table 1.1 : Sub-particles charges and Mass 

|            | Proton | Neutron | Electron     |
|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Relative mass**   | 1      | 1       | very small   |
| **Relative charge** | +1     | 0       | −1           |

**nanometers**
1 nm = 1 × 10^−9 m (0.000000001 m)


### 4. Atomic number and Atomic Mass 

- The **number of protons** in an atom's nucleus uniquely determines the identity of an element. It is like its **fingerprint**. It is called **atomic number**
- Each element has a specific and unique atomic number. For example, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 (meaning one proton), carbon has an atomic number of 6 (six protons), and gold has an atomic number of 79 (seventy-nine protons).
- If you change the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, you fundamentally change the atom's identity. It becomes another element all together

Researchers classify the different elements in the **“periodic table”** (also called **Mendeleev Table**). 

One useful way to describe an element is to use what is called **“atomic notation”**

This notation has three parts:
-	The Chemical Symbol of the element. 
-	The total number of protons and neutrons is called the mass number (we don’t add the electrons since they are so light that they barely contribute to the mass) 
-	The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number. (remember an atom has the same number of protons and electrons: to balance each other out)

3. **Importance of Electrons**: Chemical bonds (which hold atoms together in compounds) involve the electrons in these outer shells.
