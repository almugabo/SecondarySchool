---

**Card 06**

*   **Question :** Explain how Rutherford's gold foil experiment contributed to the development of the modern atomic model.

*   **Answer :**
    *   **Experiment:** Rutherford shot positively charged alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. He expected most of the particles to pass straight through, based on Thomson's model.
    *   **Results:**
        *   *Most* alpha particles *did* pass straight through.
        *   But, a *small number* of alpha particles were deflected at large angles, and some even bounced straight back.
    *   **Conclusions:**
        *   The atom is mostly *empty space* (explaining why most particles passed through).
        *   There is a small, dense, *positively charged nucleus* at the center of the atom (explaining the deflections). This nucleus contains most of the atom's mass.
    *   **Impact:** Rutherford's experiment *disproved* the "plum pudding" model and led to the *nuclear model* of the atom, where a tiny, positive nucleus is surrounded by orbiting electrons. This is the foundation of our modern understanding.

---

**Card 07**

*   **Question :** Describe in your own words what isotopes are and provide an example.

*   **Answer :** Isotopes are different versions of the *same* element. They have the *same* number of protons (same atomic number), but *different* numbers of neutrons. Because they have the same number of protons, they have the same chemical properties. It's like having different versions of a car – they all look and drive similarly, but some might have a slightly different engine (more or fewer neutrons).
    *   *Example:* Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are both isotopes of carbon. They both have 6 protons, but Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, and Carbon-14 has 8 neutrons.

---

**Card 08**

*   **Question:** Neon has three isotopes: Neon-20, Neon-21, and Neon-22. Compare the isotopes in terms of their subatomic particles.

*   **Answer :**
    *   All isotopes of neon have an atomic number of 10 (10 protons and 10 electrons).
    *    **Neon-20:** 10 protons, 10 neutrons, 10 electrons
    *   **Neon-21:** 10 protons, 11 neutrons, 10 electrons
    *   **Neon-22:** 10 protons, 12 neutrons, 10 electrons
    The *only* difference between these isotopes is the number of neutrons in their nuclei.

**Card 09**

Here are some atoms written in atomic notation:

$ ^{39}_{19}K $,  $ ^{40}_{20}Ca $,  $ ^{35}_{17}Cl $,  $ ^{37}_{17}Cl $

a) Which atom has more neutrons than protons?
b) Which atom has the fewest neutrons?
c) Which two atoms are isotopes of each other?
d) In a radioactive process, $ ^{40}_{20}Ca $ undergoes *electron capture*. This means one of the inner electrons is absorbed by the nucleus, combining with a proton. Which atom has it turned into?

---

**Answers and Explanations:**

Let's break down each part of the exercise:

**a) Which atom has more neutrons than protons?**

*   **$ ^{39}_{19}K $ (Potassium-39):**
    *   Protons: 19 (atomic number)
    *   Neutrons: 39 - 19 = 20
    *   Neutrons > Protons (20 > 19) -- **This is one correct answer**

*   **$ ^{40}_{20}Ca $ (Calcium-40):**
    *   Protons: 20
    *   Neutrons: 40 - 20 = 20
    *   Neutrons = Protons

*   **$ ^{35}_{17}Cl $ (Chlorine-35):**
    *   Protons: 17
    *   Neutrons: 35 - 17 = 18
    *   Neutrons > Protons (18>17) -- **This is one correct answer.**

*    **$^{37}_{17}Cl$ (Chlorine-37)**
     *  Protons :17
     *   Neutrons: 37-17 = 20
     * Neutrons > Protons (20>17) -- **This is one correct answer**

**b) Which atom has the fewest neutrons?**

*   $ ^{39}_{19}K $: 20 neutrons
*   $ ^{40}_{20}Ca $: 20 neutrons
*   $ ^{35}_{17}Cl $: 18 neutrons -- **This is the correct answer.**
*   $ ^{37}_{17}Cl $: 20 neutrons

**c) Which two atoms are isotopes of each other?**

*   Isotopes have the *same* atomic number (same number of protons) but *different* mass numbers (different numbers of neutrons).
*   $ ^{35}_{17}Cl $ and $ ^{37}_{17}Cl $ both have an atomic number of 17. Therefore, they are isotopes of chlorine. -- **This is the correct answer.**

**d) In a radioactive process, $ ^{40}_{20}Ca $ undergoes *electron capture*. ... Which atom has it turned into?**

*   **Electron Capture:** An electron combines with a proton in the nucleus.
*   **Effect:**
    *   A proton changes into a neutron.
    *   The atomic number *decreases* by 1 (because there's one less proton).
    *   The mass number *stays the same* (because the total number of protons + neutrons doesn't change; a proton just turned into a neutron).

*   **Original Atom:** $ ^{40}_{20}Ca $ (20 protons, 20 neutrons)

*   **New Atom:**
    *   Protons: 20 - 1 = 19
    *   Neutrons: 20 + 1 = 21
    *   Mass Number: Still 40
    *   Atomic Number: 19

*   **Element with Atomic Number 19:** Potassium (K)

*   **Result:** The new atom is $ ^{40}_{19}K $.

**Key Takeaways (for the students):**

*   **Atomic Notation:** Always remember: The top number is the *mass number* (protons + neutrons), and the bottom number is the *atomic number* (protons).
*   **Isotopes:** Same element (same atomic number), different neutron count.
*   **Radioactive Processes:** These processes can change the number of protons and/or neutrons in the nucleus, *transmuting* one element into another. Electron capture is just one type of radioactive decay.

**Card 10**

*   **Question:** List and briefly describe *two* major models of the atom that have changed over time.

*   **Answer:**

    1.  **Dalton's Atomic Model (Solid Sphere Model):**
        *   *Description:* Atoms are the smallest, indivisible particles of matter.  They are like solid, hard spheres that cannot be broken down further. All atoms of a given element are identical.
        *    *(Early 1800s)*

    2.  **Thomson's Atomic Model (Plum Pudding Model):**
        *   *Description:* Atoms are *not* indivisible. They contain negatively charged electrons embedded in a sphere of positive charge, like plums in a pudding. The positive charge is evenly distributed throughout the atom.
        *  *(Late 1800s/Early 1900s)*

    3. **Rutherford's Atomic Model (Nuclear Model):**
    	* *Description:*The atom consists mostly of empty space, with a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center. The negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus.
     	* *(1911)*

    4. **Bohr Atomic Model (Planetary Model):**
          *Description:*The atom consists mostly of empty space, with a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the center. The negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus only at fixed distances.
           *(1908)*

**Card 11**

*   **Question:** Explain *why* models in science, such as the atomic model, are revised over time.

*   **Answer:** Scientific models, including the atomic model, are revised over time because of:

    1.  **New Evidence:** Scientists conduct experiments and make observations. When *new experimental evidence* is found that *cannot be explained* by the existing model, the model must be modified or replaced. This is the core of the scientific method.
    2.  **Improved Technology:** As technology advances, scientists can make more precise measurements and observe things they couldn't see before. This can lead to discoveries that challenge existing models. For example, Rutherford's gold foil experiment relied on the ability to detect alpha particles, a technology not available to Dalton.
    3.  **Better Understanding:** Sometimes, even without completely new evidence, scientists develop a *deeper theoretical understanding* of the underlying principles. This can lead to refinements of existing models or the development of entirely new ones.
    4.  **Limitations of Existing Models:** Existing models might be good at explaining some phenomena but fail to explain others. A revised model aims to provide a more *complete and accurate* explanation of all known observations. For example, Rutherford's model couldn't explain why electrons didn't spiral into the nucleus.
	5. **Testing hypothesis:** Scientists conduct experiments to test hypothesis, leading to either the confirmation or the refutation of theories.

In essence, scientific models are *not* meant to be the final, absolute truth. They are the *best current explanations* based on available evidence. They are constantly being tested, refined, and sometimes replaced as our knowledge and understanding grow. The evolution of the atomic model is a perfect example of this iterative process.

**Card 26: The Essentials**

*   **Question:** What are the most crucial things to remember about atoms

*   **Answer:**

    1.  **Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter.** Everything around you is made of atoms.
    2.  **Atoms are made of subatomic particles:**
        *   *Protons* (positive charge, in the nucleus)
        *   *Neutrons* (no charge, in the nucleus)
        *   *Electrons* (negative charge, orbiting the nucleus)
    3.  **Atomic Number = Number of Protons = Identity of the Element.** This number defines what element an atom is.
    4.  **Mass Number = Protons + Neutrons.** This represents the approximate mass of a specific isotope.
    5. **Isotopes** are atoms that belong to the same element (same number of protons), but they have different numbers of neutrons.
    6. **The atomic model has evolved over time.** Scientists like Dalton, Thomson, Rutherford, and Bohr developed progressively more accurate models based on new experimental evidence. The current model is a *quantum mechanical model*, which is much more complex than the earlier models, but all models build upon previous discoveries. The key is that *scientific models are always subject to revision* as new evidence emerges.
