---

**Card 7**

*   **Question:** Can compounds be separated? If yes, how?



---

**Card 8**

*   **Question:** Define a mixture in your own words. How is it fundamentally different from a compound?



---

**Card 9**

*   **Question:** Explain the significance of the phrase "not chemically bonded" in the definition of a mixture.



---

**Card 10**

*   **Question:** Unlike compounds, mixtures don't have fixed ratios. Explain what this means, and give an example (e.g., different types of trail mix).



---

**Card 11**

*   **Question:** Name at least *three* different methods for separating mixtures. For *each* method you named, briefly describe *how* it works and what *type* of mixture it's best suited for.



---

**Card 12**

*   **Question:** Explain the difference between a homogeneous mixture and a heterogeneous mixture and give an example of each type of mixture.

---

**Card 13**

*   **Question:** Is air a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture? Explain your reasoning.


---

**Card 14**

*   **Question:** Is a pizza a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture? Explain your reasoning.


---

**Card 15**

*   **Question:** Classify It!: I'm going to give you a list of substances. For each one, classify it as an element, a compound, or a mixture. If it's a mixture, further classify it as homogeneous or heterogeneous.

    *   Salt (NaCl)
    *   Oxygen gas (O₂)
    *   Air
    *   Sugar water
    *   Soil
    *   Iron (Fe)
    *   Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
    *   Granite (a type of rock)
    *   Pure water (H₂O)


# 2. Atomic Theory 



**Card 01**

    *   Protons
    *   Neutrons
    *   Electrons


---

**Card 03**

*   **Question :** Define atomic number and mass number and explain their significance in identifying elements.

---

**Card 04**

*   **Question :** Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon with an atomic number of 6. How many protons, neutrons, and electrons does it have?

---

**Card 05**

*   **Question :** Compare Dalton's atomic theory with the J.J. Thomson's current model.


---

**Card 06**

*   **Question :** Explain how Rutherford's gold foil experiment contributed to the development of the modern atomic model.


---

**Card 07**

*   **Question :** Describe in your own words what isotopes are and provide an example.

---

**Card 08**

*   **Question:** Neon has three isotopes: Neon-20, Neon-21, and Neon-22. Compare the isotopes in terms of their subatomic particles.

---
**Card 09**

Here are some atoms written in atomic notation:

$ ^{39}_{19}K $,  $ ^{40}_{20}Ca $,  $ ^{35}_{17}Cl $,  $ ^{37}_{17}Cl $

a) Which atom has more neutrons than protons?
b) Which atom has the fewest neutrons?
c) Which two atoms are isotopes of each other?
d) In a radioactive process, $ ^{40}_{20}Ca $ undergoes *electron capture*. This means one of the inner electrons is absorbed by the nucleus, combining with a proton. Which atom has it turned into?

---

**Card 10**

*   **Question:** List and briefly describe *two* major models of the atom that have changed over time.

---

**Card 11**

*   **Question:** Explain *why* models in science, such as the atomic model, are revised over time.


---
**Card 26: The Essentials**

*   **Question:** What are the most crucial things to remember about atoms

---

# 3. Periodic Table 

**Card 01**

*   **Question:** What is the Periodic Table? Explain it in your own words so that a person who has never heard of it can understand it.

---

**Card 02**

*   **Question:** How many known elements are there?
